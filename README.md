This is a home assignment I've done as a part of the job interviewing process at sett.ai company

**PS**. The interview process at sett.ai is completely messed up and the feedback provided afterwards is total bs. After a month-long process, completing a home assignment and doing three rounds of interviews (two out of three rounds were conducted entirely in English), the only feedback they provided, with a one-week delay, was something like: "your English sucks". I acknowledge that English is not my native language and its definitely far from perfect. But seriously, is this the only feedback you can provide after so much time was spent?
